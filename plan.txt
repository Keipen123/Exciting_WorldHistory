Flow: 
    1. input data
    2. all data gets stored into array or object
    3. data is compared with 模範data
    4. if all input matches the 模範データ, girl strips
    5. have a few rounds of this until the girl is fully naked

Components:
    1. input data component
    2. store data component
    3. correct answers component
    4. women image component
    5. problem data component

Mutations:
    if needed (idk how it works yet)

Routes:
    Minimum: 
        none (only one page)
    Maximum: 
        opening screen, game screen, ending results screen

Backend:
    if have energy, store data in firebase

How it works:

    The "round" variable is shared among all files [states].

    Everytime an answer is submitted [input data component],
    the round increase by 1 [Mutations].

    Since the variables for the questions [problem data component], images [women image component],and choices [input data component] 
    are all bind to the round variable,
    the increment in round will mean change in its variables.
    Thus, each data change to next stage.

    Whenever a button [input data component] is pressed, the data is emitted to a storage [store data component].
    The data [store data component] is compared with the correct answers [correct answers component] each time.
    If it is true, the player can go to the next stage. If not, fails.
